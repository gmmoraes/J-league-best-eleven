#J-league-best-eleven
This app allows the users to chose their team of the week for the 2016 Japanese soccer league (J-league).

Each user needs to vote for 11 players where one of them needs to be a goalkeeper and at least three players need to be defenders.

Basically this app scrapes the J-league website in order to get the list of players that have played during the week storing the information in a list.

The list is passed to Javascript by being transformed in to Json, where the information is stored in a datatable so that the user can interact with it.
